## üìù Introduction

This repository contains all of my C++ modules from the 42 curriculum, designed to introduce students to Object-Oriented Programming and C++ fundamentals through a series of increasingly complex exercises.

> "From procedural to object-oriented: a journey through the core of C++."

Each module focuses on specific C++ concepts, gradually building a comprehensive understanding of the language and its features.
